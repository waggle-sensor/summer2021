## Abstract
Waggle/Sage is an initiative at Argonne National Lab to combine edge-computing and scientific sensing. This software-defined approach to scientific data collection 
and processing has allowed Waggle nodes to be deployed in numerous settings, both urban and natural. However, as an edge-computing focused design, the Waggle 
platform is geared more towards sophisticated, energy intensive, and high-bandwidth sensors. Scenarios where there is a limitation on space/available energy call 
for small, energy-harvesting sensors, which are any devices that harness external power sources (i.e. solar, thermal, etc). The purpose of this project was to 
develop a framework to integrate energy-harvesting sensors into the Waggle architecture. The framework involves placing many energy-harvesting sensors in proximity 
to a Waggle node and connecting them wirelessly to the node via LoRa technology. Attached to the Waggle node, a LoRaWAN private server module and gateway will 
receive and manage the data collected by the energy-harvesting sensors.
