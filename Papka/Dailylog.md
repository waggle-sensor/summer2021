Week of 6/21
- begin work on bee detector by working through cloud detection example
- work on tutorial to train AI for ML/AI beginners. 
- Continue work on cloud detection example through a Chameleon machine 

Week of 6/28
- Begin to work on training the bee detector
- Downloading training dataset (labels and images)
- Leased a Chameleon cloud
- Find a way to convert xml files to jpg

Week of 7/5
- Continue to work on bee detector training
  - troubleshooting issues of running training model
      -seems to be an issue with the labelled images not matching what the training code is looking for

Week of 7/12
- The issues of the labelled images seems to have been solved. The images were not all the same size and the code used to produce the labelled images only created one size for the labels rather then it matching each image's size. 
   - The training dataset was then sorted into smaller sets that corresponded to size so that the code will be able to correctly match the images together to train. 
- The session times out before the training can be completed so I need to find away around that
- Continue working on written tutorial for training the AI. 

Week of 7/19
- This week I would like to try to finish training for the deeplab model 
  - I am still trying to solve the issue of my ssh session timing out, I am going to try Tmux once the Chameleon machine is back online. 
- My Chameleon machine had problems coming back after the power being turned off so I had to try to start over and now I cannot launch an instance

Week of 7/26
- I am still waiting for the Chameleon issue to be solved and/or a node to become available (hopefully beginning of next week)
- I am going to begin working on my blog post for the Sage website. 
- Also working on midpoint presentation for 8/11

Week of 8/2 and 8/9 
- Finished up training and inference for the bee detector
- was finally able to get a Chameleon lease so I could complete the bee detector

Week of 8/16 
- Worked on deliverables
