    * (My project assignment is still TBD)

### Wednesday June 2, 2021 ###
- Successfully built and trained the facemask identification 'hello world' waggle plugin from 
[this repository](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/plugin-helloworld-ml).
- Attended Day 2 of virtual orientation.
- Finished the SEC101 (CounterIntelligence Training)
- Spoke with Sean about work on object tracking with OpenCV
- Began [notes on OpenCV Object Tracking](notes/opencv_tracking.pdf)
- Started work on an experimental OpenCV image tracking plugin: [plugin-motion-detector](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/plugin-motion-detector)

### Thursday June 3, 2021 ###
- Completed ESH100 (ES&H Orientation)
- Completed ESH196A (Hazard Communication)
- Read through the [Bolme paper on MOSSE filters](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~draper/papers/bolme_cvpr10.pdf) for object tracking.
- Did a brief review of FFT (convolution and correlation theorems, as shown [here](http://ugastro.berkeley.edu/infrared/ir_clusters/convolution.pdf)).

### Friday Hune 4, 2021 ###
- Finished notes on MOSSE filters, which can be found [here](notes/opencv_tracking.pdf).
- Read up on the existing (cross-platform?) docs for opencv
    * I'm still a bit confused about the translation between the standard C++ api and the python api. The bindings seem autogenerated, which means that they mimic the C++ api with high fidelity, but there are some packaging quirks that are not well documented (such as their legacy packages).
- Implemented MOSSE filters in the plugin-motion-detection repository.
    * I still need permissions to commit to this repo; I am commiting locally on my machine.

## Week 1 ##
### Monday June 7, 2021 ###
- Wrote some manual logic to handle the detection of occluded objects in `plugin-motion-detector`
- Did some reading on the YOLO model paper
    * The YOLO model seems to yield good results, but may not perform well in a general object detection setting, so custom models may need to be trained to detect "canonical" objects in the deployment setting

    * 
### Tuesday June 8, 2021 ###
- Imported part of the KITTI multi-object tracking dataset for autonomous vehicles
    * This dataset is quite large (and the image aspect ratios are non-standard), so it requires a lot of cleaning.
    * This dataset may serve as a good proof-of-concept for tranferring the YOLO model to a specific use case, given a clean, labeled dataset.

- Obtained push permissions for the `plugin-motion-detector` repository.

### Wednesday June 9, 2021 ###
- Continued work on training YOLO on the KITTI vehicle detection dataset
- Read Farneback's paper on fast dense optical flow

### Thursday June 10, 2021 ###
- Cleaned up the YOLO implementation in `plugin-motion-detector`
    * It would be great to investigate training a custom YOLO model, assuming we have field data to do so.
- Attended CELS lecture

### Friday June 11, 2021 ###
- Met with Sean and Nicola to discuss research progress and answer questions
- Began work on documenting `plugin-motion-detector`
- Began work on my [Introductory Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16wMCOGvX0aUp60ZUvsId03z5qRBw1jx-/view?usp=sharing).
    * The LaTeX source can be found [here](presentations/project_intro/project_intro.tex).

## Week 2 ##
### Monday June 14, 2021 ###
- Completed and proofread my introductory presentation.
- Attended Weekly Team Meeting
- Attended Intern Presentation Meeting (part I)
- Presented my introductory presentation.
- Caught the end of the Quantum Computing Tutorial (day 1)

### Tuesday June 15, 2021 ###
- Attended CV intern check-in.
- Attended Quantum Computing Tutorial (day 2)
- Began work on PCA-based anomaly detection of static images

### Wednesday June 16, 2021 ###
- Attended SULI EDU Seminar
- Attended Quantum Computing Tutorial (day 3)
- Continued work on PCA-based anomaly detection
    * I have been experimenting with kernel-based PCA, which gives okay results but
      is very memory hungry, as it requires the model to be deployed along with its training       dataset.

### Thursday June 17, 2021 ###
- Attended CV intern check-in.
- Attended Quantum Computing Tutorial (day 4)
- Finished exploration of PCA-based anomaly detection
    * I have concluded that PCA-based anomaly detection only seems to pick up on
      color-based anomalies, and does a poor job of picking up on shape-based anomalies,
      even under the discrete cosine transform (i.e. JPEG-style compression).
    * In order to obtain more robust, non-linear anomaly detection, it might be worthwhile 
      to investigate the use of convolutional autoencoders (CAEs).
- Attended CELS Lecture (featuring Scott Collis!)

### Friday June 18, 2021 ###
- Attended Quantum Computing Tutorial (day 5)
- Download and annotated a "fake" anomaly detection dataset based on the NEON site datasets.
    * The data portal for NEON can be found here:
- Began work on a convolutional autoencoder model for anomaly detection

## Week 3 ##
### Monday June 21, 2021 ###
- Attended Weekly Team Meeting
- Attended Intern Presentation Meeting (part II)
- Continued work on Convolutional Autoencoder
    * Since I built the model in the latest Tensorflow container, I needed to update my Nvidia
      drivers. Since driver updates come with my OS updates, I updated my OS, which messed up
      my GRUB bootloader. Fixing this took a significant chunk out of both my afternoon and my 
      sanity. Just another exciting tale from the *Linux Experience* :)
- Eventually got the model training on my GPU! Woot!

### Tuesday June 22, 2021 ###
- Began generating data for the CAE (using photoshop, etc. to create more anomalies)
- Continued reading papers on the use of CAEs and AAEs to detect anomalies
- Attended CV intern check-in

### Wednesday June 23, 2021 ###
- Began investigating methods for filtering out background noise of convolutional autoencoders.
    * I found a method (using gamma distributions) to better account for differing variations
      in a still-frane image at the per-pixel level. It seems that most of the literature simply
      uses thresholding of the loss function to determine where anomalies exist in the frame.
      This method entails determining a sort-of "per-pixel p-value", which for a specified low
      alpha value (the estimated "likelihood") can be used as a more robust filter to either
      "accept" or "reject" each pixel as anomalous based on the reconstruction loss.
- Attended EDU Weekly Seminar (on how to optimize my LinkedIn profile)
- Attended the "Mid-week CELS social hour"

### Thursday June 24, 2021 ###
- Attended CV intern check-in
- Attended CELS Lecture Series (on classical methods for predictive modeling)
- Finished Neon CAE model and plotted relevant metrics (like ROC curve, AUC, etc.)
    * I may see if it is worthwhile adapting this model into a Waggle plugin.

### Friday June 25, 2021 ###
- Did some recommended reading (some great paper recommendations by Nicola!)
- Pushed anomaly detection notebooks to a [waggle-sensor repository](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/anomaly-detection).
- Began some refactoring work on the motion-detector plugin

## Week 4 ##
### Monday June 28, 2021 ###
- Did some reading on adversarial autoencoders
    * Through this reading, I haven't been convinced that imposing some kind of distribution for image encodings will
      result in better prediction accuracy; this only seems useful for certain tasks like generating adversarial
      examples of anomalies. This might be worth exploring, but I would like to talk to an expert about this first.
- Refactored the [motion detector plugin](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/plugin-motion-detector) to publish data to SAGE.
    * I may want to schedule a code review with Sean to discuss if there need to be changes to the way the plugin
      publishes object data (particularly if we want to support multi-object tracking).

### Tuesday June 29, 2021 ###
- Attended CV intern check-in.
- Began taking notes on online learning methods.
- Began doing some reading on attention-based machine learning models.
    * I found DeepMind's video lecture on [Attention and Memory in Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIiwuClvH6k) to be very informative.

### Wednesday June 30, 2021 ###
- Began implementation of a Variational Autoencoder for anomaly detection.
- Read papers about Convolutional Variational Autoencoders
    * The following paper using guided attention mechanisms seems to be a promising step forward: [Attention-Guided Anomaly Localization in Images (Venkataramanan et al.)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08616.pdf).
    * The attention mechanism in the paper above is the [Grad-CAM algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02391.pdf).

### Thursday July 1, 2021 ###
- Began training a Variational Autoencoder on the NEON Dataset
    * I plan on benchmarking this model against the non-variational autoencoder.
