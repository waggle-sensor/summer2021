* Application project question: How can we use computer vision to detect and measure snow cover?
* Looked into YOLOV3 examples and CVAT for labeling.

<br />

### June 23, 2021 (Day 17)
Updates:
* Met with Nicole for one-on-one 'office hours,' since I felt very lost on project. We discussed the ROI/HoughP notebook. She helped me by clarifying what should be done next. I will be furthering my ROI model on images with varying features (i.e. snowing, cloudy, sunny, etc...), essentially testing different parameters and building the training set for the ML algorithm. CNN can be used later for determining snow cover. 
* TLDR: We will be using ML rather than manual image labeling. DL can be easily applied later for snow detection.
* The tentative project outline:
    (1) Input Images
    (2) ML algorithm classifies images. The classification identifies parameters for edge detection/LSD.
    (3) Run appropriate LSD program to identify lines (i.e. the three poles).
    (4) TBD: probably run CNN
* Worked on implementing createFastLineDetector() into the ROI/HoughP JN. The initial line detections have been very weak. 
* Sources:
    (1) [Fast line detector](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/df/ded/group__ximgproc__fast__line__detector.html). 
    (2) [How to use OpenCV4's FastLineDetector in Python 3?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57017927/how-to-use-opencv4s-fastlinedetector-in-python-3). 
    (3) [A new fast line detection algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1627457)
 
To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

<br />

### June 24, 2021 (Day 18)
Updates:
* Meeting with Computer Vision Group. Discussed progress for this week.
* Tinkered with ways to improve createFastLineDetector() for detection of poles. The middle pole is the only one with 'perfect' line detection, mainly because it is facing towards the camera. The left and right poles are at an angle, so only the lines closest to the camera can be detected. 
* Found someone asking a similar question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57080937/increase-accuracy-of-detecting-lines-using-opencv). The recommended procedure is (1) Convert image to grayscale, (2) Apply a sharpening kernel (3) Threshold image, (4) Perform morphological operations to smooth/filter image. Unfortunately, this did not perform as well on the snow images as it did on their examples. The sharpening created more noise from the snow.
* Tried blurring methods as suggested by this [source](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/04/28/opencv-smoothing-and-blurring/). The results improved significantly as background noises were reduced. This enabled the lines to be detected on the poles. Spent the rest of the time optimizing this. 

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

<br />

### June 25, 2021 (Day 19)
Updates:
* Continued optimizing the program. Results can be found [here]() comparing different results with and without blurring. 
* Finalized the Jupyter Notebook. This can be found [here](). 
* Created a separate Python program which can be ran quickly. I created fixed ROI regions, so it can be consistent for every image. This can be found [here](). The program is capable of detecting lines for a separate image with similar lighting and snow conditions. 
* Looked into feature extraction methods for images. One feature that can be extracted is color. That can be useful for identifying parameters. 
* Source: [Color Identification using KMeans and OpenCV](https://www.kaggle.com/shubhanshugupta/color-identification-using-kmeans-and-opencv)

* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials.
