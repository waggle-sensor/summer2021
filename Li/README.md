## Estimating Snow Coverage Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning

Greetings! My name is Jeffrey Li. I recently graduated from Emory University this past spring with a double major in chemistry and computer science. I pursued the SULI internship with Argonne National Laboratory this summer, because I wanted to explore and learn more cool applications of machine learning beyond the usual classroom coursework. In this project, I examined methods for more efficiently measure snow using computer vision and machine learning. Through this work, I hope to present a useful tool for the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) project in aid of the organizationâ€™s research efforts. 

There are many components in this project, so it can be easy to get lost. However, I incorporated a README file in each section, with the hope of helping you find what you need. 

* [Readings](./Readings): Readily available PDFs of literature I read or implemented into my project. 
* [project_code](./project_code): Working Python programs!
* [DailyLog.md](./DailyLog.md): Day-to-day journals documenting updates that occur when working on the project or other tasks during the internship.

Other useful links:
* [Sage Site](https://sagecontinuum.org/science/snow-rod-segmentation): Small blog post on my work at Argonne. 
* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17bq1Bkhvm97tHgI4XMZW5_EyXvHYTIy3?usp=sharing): Lots of files can be found here including datasets, initial sample codes, and results. Need permission to access.
