## Estimating Snow Coverage Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning

Greetings! My name is Jeffrey Li. I recently graduated from Emory University this past spring with a double major in chemistry and computer science. I pursued the SULI internship with Argonne National Laboratory this summer, because I wanted to explore and learn more cool applications of machine learning beyond the usual classroom coursework. In this project, I examined methods for more efficiently measure snow using computer vision and machine learning. Through this work, I hope to present a useful tool for the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) project in aid of the organization’s research efforts. 

There are many components in this project, so it can be easy to get lost. However, I incorporated a README file in each section, with the hope of helping you find what you need. 

* Readings: Readily available PDFs of literature I read or implemented into my project. 
* project_code: Working Python programs!
* DailyLog.md: Day-to-day journals documenting updates that occur when working on the project or other tasks during the internship.
