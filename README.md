Hello and welcome! Here are some links and instructions to help you around.


## Getting Started

Please do not add large files to git repositories if possible. Please ask your supervisor where to put them.

## Google Drive
If you need to create documents, spreadsheets and share them, feel free to create a folder named per your lastname in our shared [Google Drive Summer2021](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1njZeZ_OMHzq_Boqq-nnEhC31kd1-coqr) and link to your GitHub files. Send us you google email address via slack, so we can share trhat folder with you.

## Tiles 
To give you an opportunity to present yourself and to get to know the others we ask our students to fill out a google slide. You can find the template `Student_Quadchart_Template` in the google drive folder above.

## Daily blogs
This is a space to keep your daily blogs and maintain a `README.md` with links to resources that may be shared using non-Git avenues. Please create a folder named per your last name.

## Presentations
In addition to the presentations mentioned under Deliverables below, we want students also to give 10-minute presentations at the beginning and midpoint of their internship.
