# Summer 2021

Hello and welcome! Here are some links and instructions to help you around.


## Getting Started

New here?  Check out the [getting started](getting_started.md) readme.

## Slack
We will invite you to our slack workspace. Please let us know if you have not been invited. 


## Google Drive
If you need to create documents, spreadsheets and share them, feel free to create a folder named per your lastname in our shared [Google Drive Summer2021](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1njZeZ_OMHzq_Boqq-nnEhC31kd1-coqr) and link to your GitHub files. Send us you google email address via slack, so we can share trhat folder with you.

## Tiles 
To give you an opportunity to present yourself and to get to know the others we ask our students to fill out a google slide. You can find the template `Student_Quadchart_Template` in the google drive folder above.

## Daily blogs
This is a space to keep your daily blogs and maintain a `README.md` with links to resources that may be shared using non-Git avenues. Please create a folder named per your last name.

[Here](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/summer2018/tree/master/morrison) is an example of a student space organization. Please follow it in organizing your space.


## Deliverables

For our SULI students there are four required deliverables:

1. Oral or Poster Presentation
2. One-page peer review

(Detailed instructions should have been shared with these students)


For all other interns we expect at the end of their internship:

1. Oral presentation
2. Abstract for General Audience (on github)
3. A white paper OR a real publication. In either case the daily blog on github can serve as a basis for the content. 4-8 pages, please use the LaTeX template or the overleaf template.
