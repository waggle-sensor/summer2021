## Notes

- Final week! This week I want to wrap up my deliverables (since they are due) and gather data on our profiling/scheduling solution.
- Trying to understand Kubernetes implementation on NX and install it so that I can test out a few apps with its multi-tenancy features
  - Using the Kubernetes on NX tutorial at: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/deploying-ai-apps-with-egx-on-jetson-xavier-nx-microservers/
